# Interview Q&A — Password Security

## 1) What makes a password strong?
- Length: 14–16+ characters, or 5–7 random words.
- Unpredictability: avoid dictionary words and common patterns.
- Variety: mix upper/lower/digits/symbols or use truly random passphrases.
- Uniqueness: never reuse passwords across sites.
- MFA: pair passwords with multi‑factor authentication when available.

## 2) What are common password attacks?
- Brute force: trying all combinations.
- Dictionary: testing common words and variants (e.g., leetspeak).
- Credential stuffing: using breached username/password pairs on other sites.
- Password spraying: trying a few common passwords across many accounts.
- Phishing/social engineering: tricking users into revealing credentials.
- Keylogging/malware: recording keystrokes or stealing from memory.

## 3) Why is password length important?
- Each extra character exponentially expands the search space.
- Longer passwords/passphrases dramatically increase brute‑force time.

## 4) What is a dictionary attack?
- An attack that tries likely words and common patterns (and mutations like 0→o, 1→l) instead of testing all combinations.

## 5) What is multi‑factor authentication (MFA)?
- An additional verification factor beyond the password (e.g., OTP, authenticator app, security key, push prompt, biometrics) that reduces account takeover risk.

## 6) How do password managers help?
- Generate strong random passwords, store them securely, auto‑fill, and keep each account unique. They reduce reuse and weak choices.

## 7) What are passphrases?
- Sequences of random words (e.g., 5–7) that are long and high‑entropy, yet easier to remember than random character strings.

## 8) What are common mistakes in password creation?
- Using dictionary words, names, dates, seasons/years.
- Short length or predictable patterns (CapitalizedWord+123!).
- Reusing passwords across sites.
- Sharing passwords or storing them in plain text.
- Testing real passwords on public strength checkers.

### Best practices (quick list)
- Length first; randomness second; uniqueness always.
- Use a password manager and enable MFA everywhere.
- Prefer passphrases for memorized credentials.
- Rotate credentials after compromise or policy‑driven triggers.
