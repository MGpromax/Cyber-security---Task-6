# Task 6 — Procedure: Create Strong Passwords and Evaluate Strength

Important: Do not test any real password you use. Only use disposable examples for demonstrations.

## 1) Brainstorm sample passwords with varying complexity
- Weak: single dictionary word, short length (e.g., "password").
- Medium: add capitalization, numbers, or a symbol (e.g., "Password1").
- Strong: 14–16+ fully random characters from upper/lower/digits/symbols.
- Passphrases: 4–6 uncommon random words, separated by dashes/spaces.

## 2) Generate candidates
- Use a password manager to generate 16–20 character random strings.
- Create 5–6 word passphrases with separators; avoid common phrases.

## 3) Open an online strength checker
- Example: https://passwordmeter.com/
- Use a private/incognito window.
- Confirm you are not pasting real or reused credentials.

## 4) Test each example and note results
- Score (percentage or rating reported by the tool).
- Feedback (e.g., "too short", "uses common pattern", "add symbols").
- Observations: how changing length/charset affects the score.

## 5) Compare patterns
- Short vs long; dictionary word vs random; predictable structure vs random.
- Passphrase with 4 words vs 6 words.

## 6) Summarize best practices learned
- Prefer longer, random, unique passwords or multi-word random passphrases.
- Use a password manager; enable MFA.

## 7) Document your findings
- Save your notes/scores and feedback in README.md (or a report file).
- Optionally add screenshots (do not include real passwords).

## 8) Submit to GitHub
- Include: README.md, procedure.md, passwords.txt, interview-qa.md, and screenshots (optional).
